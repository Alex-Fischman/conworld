			All words are a list of roots concatenated together, where the first root specifies the meaning and the rest of them modify the first one. This eliminates the difference between nouns and adjectives. Also, every word can be used as either a noun or a verb, which means that there is no classification of words. The sentence structure is best analyzed as VSO, with the word that acts as the verb coming first.<br>
			Informal words, such as names or slang, break the phonological rules slightly. For example, they may incorporate voiced phonemes, or omit an initial consonant. Different dialects typically have different sets of altered phonemes. However, these words are still written with their normal phonemes.

			All living creatures can hold a certain amount of mana. All thinking creatures can use mana to cast spells. However, if a creature runs out of mana, it dies.<br>
			Casting is done by creating shapes in the universe with intent. (Drawing or speaking the spell helps create the shape but is not necessary.) Casting is normally accomplished by channeling mana through a body part (like a hand or finger) and then writing the spell, but mana can also be channeled through any object that the thinking creature can consider a part of itself (for example, a swordmaster's sword).<br>
			Objects that creatures can use to channel are called focuses. Focuses can be summoned by giving them a name and then casting that name as a spell. This creates a shape in the universe that the object can be stored in. The slightly altered pronounciation of names reduces the ambiguity from simply casting a spell.<br>
			Objects can also be etched or engraved with the symbols for a spell. A creature can then cast that spell more easily by filling those symbols with mana. However, while inanimate objects can channel mana, they cannot store it.<br>
			Some non-thinking creatures have evolved to have symbols embedded in their bodies. While they cannot choose to activate these spells, the natural mana in their bodies will sometimes fill those symbols when the animal experiences a strong emotion.
