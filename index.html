			<p>All words are a list of roots concatenated together, where the first root specifies the meaning and the rest of them modify the first one. This eliminates the difference between nouns and adjectives. Roots used as modifiers act as suffixes. For example, "different" would be "same not".<br>There is an implicit "to be" in every sentence. "To change" is "to be different", "to have" is "to be possessed", "to give" is "to be possessed different(ly)", etc. This eliminates the difference between nouns and verbs. The sentence structure is best analyzed as VSO; the word that modifies "to be" comes at the beginning.<br>Questions are posed using "li".</p>

			<p>All living creatures can hold a certain amount of mana. All thinking creatures can use mana to cast spells. However, if a creature runs out of mana, it dies.<br>Casting is done by creating shapes in the universe. (Speaking the spell helps create the shape but is not necessary.) Casting is normally accomplished by channeling mana through a body part (like a hand or finger), but mana can also be channeled through any object that the thinking creature can consider a part of itself (for example, a swordmaster's sword).<br>Objects that creatures can use to channel are called focuses. Focuses can be summoned by giving them a name and then casting that name as a spell. This creates a shape in the universe that the object can be stored in.</p>
